## Natural Language

The Natural Language framework provides a variety of natural language processing (NLP) functionality with support for many different languages and scripts. 

* [Tokenization](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/naturallanguage/tokenizing_natural_language_text) (iOS 12.0+)
	* Breaking up a piece of text into linguistic units or tokens such as words, sentences and paragraphs.
* [Language Identification](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/naturallanguage/identifying_the_language_in_text) (iOS 12.0+)
	* Automatically detecting the language of a piece of text.
* Linguistic Tags (iOS 12.0+)
	* [Identifying Parts of Speech,](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/naturallanguage/identifying_parts_of_speech) classify nouns, verbs, adjectives, and other parts of speech in a string.

		```swift
		func retrievePOS(from text: String) -> [String] {
	    let tagger = NLTagger(tagSchemes: [.lexicalClass])
	    tagger.string = text
	    
	    var tags = [String]()
	    let options: NLTagger.Options = [.omitPunctuation, .omitWhitespace]
	    tagger.enumerateTags(in: text.startIndex..<text.endIndex, unit: .word, scheme: .lexicalClass, options: options) { (tag, tokenRange) -> Bool in
	        if let tag = tag {
	            tags.append(tag.rawValue)
	        }
	        return true
	    }
	    return tags
		}
		
		let posTags = retrievePOS(from: "Loving someone is such a lovely feeling! I love it")
		print(posTags)
		
		// output: ["Verb", "Noun", "Verb", "Adjective", "Determiner", "Adjective", "Noun", "Pronoun", "Verb", "Pronoun"]
		```
	* [Named entity recognition](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/naturallanguage/identifying_people_places_and_organizations), identifying tokens as names of people, places, or organizations.
	* Lemmatization, the idea behind lemmatizing a word is turning both lover and loving into the same lemma: love.

		```swift
		import NaturalLanguage
	
		func retrieveLemmas(from text: String) -> [String] {
		    let tagger = NLTagger(tagSchemes: [.lemma])
		    tagger.string = text
		    
		    var tags = [String]()
		    let options: NLTagger.Options = [.omitPunctuation, .omitWhitespace]
		    tagger.enumerateTags(in: text.startIndex..<text.endIndex, unit: .word, scheme: .lemma, options: options) { (tag, tokenRange) -> Bool in
		        if let tag = tag {
		            tags.append(tag.rawValue)
		        }
		        return true
		    }
		    return tags
		}
		
		let lemmas = retrieveLemmas(from: "Loving someone is such a lovely feeling! I love it")
		print(lemmas)
		
		// output: ["love", "someone", "be", "such", "a", "lovely", "feeling", "I", "love", "it"]
		```
