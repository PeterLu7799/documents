# Object Detection

## What prediction 

1. Class name
2. Bounding box 

## Sliding window detector

### Problems

Q: How to define the window size?

A: Image pyramid is created by scaling the original image to get multiple scaled image to fit the fixed window size.

## Popular Methodologies

### Histogram of Oriented Gradients

1. Computationally inexpensive 
2. Good for real-world problems
3. Calculate features by SVM

### Regin-based Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN)

1. CNN is computationally expensive 
2. Using object proposal algorithm called Selective Search to get regin or bounding box
3. Warped image regions to feed to CNN based clasifier
4. SVM to predict
5. Optimize patches by training bounding box regresssion

#### Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP-net)

1. Calculate the CNN representation for entire image only once
2. Use the calculated CNN representation for each patch generated by Selective Search
3. It uses spatial pooling after the last convelutional layer

#### Faster R-CNN

1. Region Proposal Network - replace selective search with a very small convolutional network.
2. Anchor boxes introduced 

### Regression-based 

#### YOLO (You Only Look Once)

1. Divides each image into a grid of SxS 
2. Each grid predicts N bounding boxes and confidence

#### Single Shot Detector (SSD)
